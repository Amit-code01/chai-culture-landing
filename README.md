# 🍵 Chai Culture - Coming Soon Landing Page

A responsive landing page built for **Chai Culture**, designed to reflect the brand’s royal heritage and elegance.  
The page includes logo, tagline (*“Brew the Royal Tradition”*), brand description, email signup, launch info, and social links — styled with warm tones of gold, deep browns, and cream for a premium feel.

### Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React + Vite)
- No external CSS frameworks — handcrafted styles for precision and brand fit

### Deployment
- **Live Demo**: [https://your-deployed-link.netlify.app](https://your-deployed-link.netlify.app)  
- **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/your-username/chai-culture-landing](https://github.com/your-username/chai-culture-landing)

### Design Choices
I used a **royal, elegant theme** with warm tones to capture Chai Culture’s authenticity.  
Animations (push-up fade-in) add a premium, engaging feel while keeping the layout minimal, responsive, and user-focused.
